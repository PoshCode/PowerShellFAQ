Note that for the "book" version on [PoshCode.org/PowerShellFAQ](https://PoshCode.org/PowerShellFAQ) you must add the question as a link in the [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellFAQ/blob/master/src/SUMMARY.md).

# Can I add a question without an answer?

To add a question without an answer, use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellFAQ/issues). We can't guarantee that all of these will be added, because sometimes answers are just too complicated for our format...

# What makes a good FAQ entry?

Any frequently asked question that can be summarized in a single sentence, and answered in one or two paragraphs. Because of limitations on some of the clients that these questions are asked on, we need each paragraph to be under 450 characters in length. If you must, you can provide multiple paragraphs, or hyperlinks to additional content.

# Can I just suggest an improvement to the answer for a question?

You can! Feel free to submit a pull request to [PoshCode/PowerShellFAQ](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellFAQ) with better answers, or to just open an issue and we'll take care of it. We welcome your contributions, whether it's new questions, corrections, updates, or suggestions for better answers!
