# Why should I learn PowerShell?

PowerShell is a cross-platform shell and scripting language that's required for managing Windows servers, and is capable of managing the cloud, including Linux and Windows, Azure, AWS and GCP. If you want to automate something, PowerShell is **both** a task-based command-line shell, *and* a powerful scripting language -- with full access to the .Net Framework. It's also **the** standard for managing Windows Server and other Microsoft server products *and services*.
