# What free PowerShell ebooks are there?

There are a lot of free eBooks available. A great list \(which includes some of those\) was compiled a few years ago by Jason Hofferle. It includes many from PowerShell.org, but there are even more published under the "Devops Collective" on GitBook. Our favorites are _The Big Book of PowerShell Gotchas_ and _Why PowerShell?_.
