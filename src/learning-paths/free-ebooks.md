# Are there any free PowerShell ebooks?

There are a lot of free eBooks available. A great list of PowerShell books (which includes some free ones) was compiled a few years ago by Jason Hofferle. It includes many from PowerShell.org, and there are more published under the "Devops Collective" on GitBook. Our favorites are *Why PowerShell?* and *The Big Book of PowerShell Gotchas*.
