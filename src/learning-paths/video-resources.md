# Are there free video classes?

There are several days worth of free PowerShell classes available via Channel 9, in fact, the first two courses we used to recommend for anyone would be the full-day length "Getting Started with Microsoft PowerShell" and "Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start" which are both presented by Microsoft Technical Fellow and inventor of PowerShell Jeffrey Snover, working with Jason Helmick.

# Are there any videos about PowerShell DSC?

Of course! Microsoft Technical Fellow and so-called ShellFather Jeffrey Snover, and current PowerShell PM Jason Helmick put together "Getting Started" and "Advanced" courses for PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration), which reach run about a whole day.

# Is there any free video training for PowerShell 5?

There's a lot. Channel 9 has a series of PowerShell 5 videos from 2016 by MVP Trevor Sullivan which are pretty short and basic on their [PowerShell show](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/MsftPowerShell). That same year, the PowerShell Team put together almost a whole day of content to celebrate the [10 year anniversary](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/PowerShell-Team/PowerShell-10-Year-Anniversary) of PowerShell in production.

There are many other videos available on MVA of course, and on Channel 9 -- including the recent 10th Anniversary event, and Jeffrey Snover and Don Jones' annual "PowerShell Unplugged" presentations at Ignite, and an awful lot of content on Pluralsight...
