# What books do you recommend for programmers?

For experts, the most comprehensive book about PowerShell is still, without a doubt, _Windows PowerShell in Action_ by Bruce Payette \(one of the language architects\). The Third Edition is available now, with updates by Richard Siddaway. It's published by Manning, so there are a couple of free chapters on their site. However, if you're a .Net developer that's just trying to pick up PowerShell, you should also have a look at _Windows PowerShell for Developers_, by Douglas Finke -- it's full of scripts that you can relate to, and that will help you learn to embedd PowerShell in your apps for scripting, automate task in development, and interact with .Net and native DLLs, COM, etc.
