# What books do you recommend for programmers?

The most comprehensive book about PowerShell is still, without a doubt, *Windows PowerShell in Action* by Bruce Payette (one of the original language architects). The Third Edition is available now, with updates by Richard Siddaway. It's published by Manning, so there are a couple of free chapters on their site.
