# Why should I learn PowerShell?

This question is really too broad, but basically the answer is: it's a cross-platform shell and scripting language that's required for managing Windows servers, and capable of managing the cloud, including Linux and Windows... If you want to automate something, PowerShell is **both** a task-based command-line shell, _and_ a powerful scripting language -- with full access to the .Net Framework. It's also **the** standard for managing Windows Server and other Microsoft server products _and services_.
