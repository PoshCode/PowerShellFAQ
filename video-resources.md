# Are there free video courses?

There are several days worth of free PowerShell classes available via Microsoft's Virtual Academy, in fact, the first two courses we would have to recommend for anyone would be the full-day length "Getting Started with Microsoft PowerShell" and "Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start" which are both presented by Microsoft Technical Fellow and inventor of PowerShell Jeffrey Snover, working with Jason Helmick.  Of course, the same duo also put together a "Getting Started" and "Advanced" courses for PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration), which reach run about a whole day as well.
